# Rails Server Template

## Overview

This is a template chef structure for deploying Rails applications. The example template and Vagrantfile provide a single VM configuration which works out of the box and can be used to deploy any Rails 4.x, 5.x or 6.x application. It can be used as a drop in replacement for platforms like Heroku or Elastic Beanstalk.

The configuration is also flexible enough to be adapted to multi machine setups.

## Documentation

This is the example code which section one of the book "Reliably Deploying Rails Applications" available from leanpub here <https://leanpub.com/deploying_rails_applications> is based.

If you run into any issues using the template provided here, please open a Github issue, I actively monitor these and will respond as quickly as possible.

## Requirements

This template is designed to work on Ubuntu 20.04 (the current LTS) and is tested regularly against Digital Ocean and Linode.

When opening an issue, please include the Ubuntu version and provider the issue was encountered on.
